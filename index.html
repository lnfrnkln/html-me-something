    <p>For as long as I can remember I have always loved music and loved to sing.
    Music is soothing and calming for me. 
    I can listen to all genres of music and find beauty in different styles of music.</p>

<h2>Singing in Church</h2>

<p>My father was the Pastor of our church. 
    So naturally,I began singing in church. 
    I led my first solo in church at the tender age of 5. 
The song was "Show Me The Way." I can vividly remember this day and I still remember every word to this song!
I was so proud of myself for singing this song when I was
so small. As I continued to develop as a singer, I began to lead more solos.  
I still sing in church today and I am a part of the Praise Team and Choir.

<h2>Singing in School</h2>

<p>My love for singing continued to grow and I began singing at school. 
I sang at several programs in Middle School. In 8th grade I sang the National Anthem at a Memphis Chicks Baseball Game.
Picture a very small young girl standing on the center of the Mound. What an experience! 
I continued to sing in High School at Overton High School under Dr. Lulah Hedgeman.
I learned several styles of music and learned to sing in foreign languages. By the time I reached my senior year,
I was in 7 choirs. Ms. Hedgeman taught me so much.</p>

<h2>Song Writing</h2>

<p>I began writing songs when I was 13 years old. In college I began working with a producer and started recording original songs.
I continued to write, record and perform songs until I had my first child.
I haven't done much lately and I am eager to start this process again.
